//Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.
//
//Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.
//
//This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.
//
//Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalizationÂ» will be spelt as "i18n".
//
//Bonus: Calculate how many times each letter appeared in the word
